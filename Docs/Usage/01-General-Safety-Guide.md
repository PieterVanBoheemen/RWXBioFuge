01 General Safety Guide
=======================

A microcentrifuge like the RWXBioFuge is a machine that is used in a lab to seperate matter based on the difference in weight.

For example when seperating liquids from solids, the liquid solution on top of the solids after centrifugation is called the "supernatant". The solids at the bottom of the tube the "pellet".

A typical microcentrifuge has a maximum speed of about 13,000 to 14,000 rpm (revolutions per minute). 

Take the following guidelines into account when using 1.5 or 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes:

- Read the [Machine Operations manual][1] thoroughly, and make sure you understand how to start and stop the machine.

- Before powering the machine up, check whether the rotor is strongly fixed to the brushless motor.

- Stress test your assembly before using it or providing it to others. Simply fill up all 20 slots with tubes containing 2 mL of water and spin at the highest speed for 30 minutes. It is wise to put the machine in a seperate room and operate it via the [Web Interface][2] for your own safety.

- Don't start on your own. Ask for help from someone who has used a microcentrifuge before to explain the machine to you and supervise the first time you use it.
 
- Make sure the rotor and centrifuge tubes are clean and intact before use.

- **Always** balance the microcentrifuge tubes to make sure all contain the same mass, or use two tubes with the exact same amount of sample. If you need to spin only one tube, fill up a second with the same mass.

- Place the balanced tubes at the exact opposite position of eachother in the rotor.

- When using 0.5 ml microcentrifuge (PCR) tubes, put them inside of a 1.5 ml tube.

- Whenever the machine starts vibrating heavily or shaking, press the Stop button immediately.

- Whenever the machine makes unusual sounds, press the Stop button and inspect the rotor.
