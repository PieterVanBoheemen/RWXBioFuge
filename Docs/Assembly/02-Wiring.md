=========

The second step is to wire all the components.

1. Prepare molex connector
2. Connect brushless motor to molex connector and ATX power supply
3. Connect power switch to ATX power supply
4. Connect Electronic Speed Controller to brushless motor
5. Wire everything to the arduino shield, overlayed with the "RWXBioFuge Shield port indicator"
  1. Connect Eletronic Speed Controller to port 1 and 2
  2. Connect infrared RPM sensor to port 3, 4, 5 and 6
  3. Connect Lid lever switch to port 7 and 8
  4. Connect Electromagnet to port 9 and 10
