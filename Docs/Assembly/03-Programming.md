03 Programming
==============

The third step is to preparing the Arduino Ethernet.

1. Download the latest RWXBioFuge source code and libraries from [Github][1].
2. Connect the USB to serial programming board to the Arduino Ethernet and put the USB cable in your computer.
3. Load the RWXBioFuge source code in the Arduino IDE.
4. Click on Upload to compile and transfer the code to the Arduino Ethernet.
5. Disconnect the USB to serial programming board from the Arduino Ethernet.
6. Assemble the RWXBioFuge proto shield on to the Arduino Ethernet.
7. Power up the RWXBioFuge and check whether the LCD starts by showing "RWXBioFuge" and continues to the settings menu.

Almost done, just one more step left: [04 Final][2].
