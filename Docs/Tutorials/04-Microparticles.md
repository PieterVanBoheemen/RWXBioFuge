04 Microparticles in cosmetics
===============================

Microparticles and nanospheres are often applied in cosmetics. The particles can be loaded with pigments and/or add positive of negative surface charge. With the right size, the particles have a ball-bearing effect in creams and lotions to give it a silky texture. In scrubs the particles are added to help remove dead cells from the skin.

In this experiment we will investigate the microparticle content of every day cosmetics.

You will need the following.

Cosmetic products, such as:
- Creams
- Lotions
- Cleansers
- Scrubs
- Powder and/or liquid concealers

Dilution agents, such as:
- Water
- Ethanol
- Acetone
- Glycerine

Procedure:
- Make dilution series of the products, for example 1:1, 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000
- Spin at maximum speed in the centrifuge for 5 minutes
- Report the amount of pelleted particles

By changing the power of the centrifuge you will get an indication of the size of the particles. The lower the speed, the havier / bigger the particles.
