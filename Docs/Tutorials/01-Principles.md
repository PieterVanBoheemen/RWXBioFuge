01 Principles of Centrifugation
===============================

The goal of this first tutorial is for you to understand the basic physics behind centrifugation.

Centrifugation is a technique often used in a laboratory to separate two liquids or a liquid and a solid. It is based on the effect of gravity on these components. Under normal circumstances two components may separate just by letting the mixture rest. Heavy components will sink to the bottom due to gravity. However, in some cases the differences are too small or other forces such as hydrophobic interactions keep components together. In these situations you need centrifugation to increase the separation rate.

Note: centrifugal force is not a force in itself, but the result of inertia.

### Centrifugal force
**Centrifugal force** is mathematically described as:
![F_{c}=mr w^{2}](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=F_%7Bc%7D%3Dmr%20w%5E%7B2%7D%20&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)

Fc is the force acting on a particle
r is the radius
m is the mass of the particle
w is the **angular velocity of the particle**

The angular velocity can also be defined as a function of Revolutions per Minute (RPM) w=2pN/60
N is the number of revolutions per minute

So the centrifugal force is:
![F_{c}=mr (2pN/60)^{2}=0.011mr N^{2}](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=F_%7Bc%7D%3Dmr%20%282pN%2F60%29%5E%7B2%7D%3D0.011mr%20N%5E%7B2%7D%20&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)

### G force
When comparing the above equation to the gravity on a particle, you will notice the similarities:
![F_(c)=mg](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=F_%7Bg%7D%3Dmg&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)

It can be seen that g is equal to 0.011rN^2. This is why the centrifugal force is often expressed as "g".

### Example

***Question:*** Let's spin a liquid at 2000 RPM at a radius of 10 cm, what is the amount of "g" on the particle?

***Answer:*** 
![g=F_{c}  \div F_{g}=(0.011r N^{2})  \div g=(0.011 \times 0.1 \times 2000^{2}) \div 9.81 = 450](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=g%3DF_%7Bc%7D%20%20%5Cdiv%20F_%7Bg%7D%3D%280.011r%20N%5E%7B2%7D%29%20%20%5Cdiv%20g%3D%280.011%20%5Ctimes%200.1%20%5Ctimes%202000%5E%7B2%7D%29%20%5Cdiv%209.81%20%3D%20450&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)
