05 Anemia diagnosis and hematocrit measurement
==============================================

> **WARNING**: Blood may carry diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis B. Wear protective gloves when handling other peoples blood and clean everything thoroughly. DIY experiments should never be interpreted as a medical diagnosis, go see a doctor instead.

Hematocrit values are measured to determine whether blood has a sufficient number of erythrocytes. These are necessary to transfer oxygen. However, if the concentration is too high, the blood's viscosity becomes a problem.

The blood of consists of plasma, red blood cells and white blood cells. When a sample is centrifuged, the red cells sink to the bottom. The plasma will be on top and a thin layer of white cells can be found on top of the red cells pellet. The volume ratio between red cells and the total volume is the Hct value.

Normal Hct values are around 47 percent for men, and 42 percent for women. Anemia occurs when the Hct value is below 40 for men, and below 37 for women.

### Materials
- Ethanol (70%)
- Soap and water
- Gloves
- Sterile lancets
- Cotton ball
- Hematocrit tubes (for which you need a hematocrit head), or small centrifuge tubes preferably graded
- Trash container

### Procedure
- Wash your hands with soap and water
- Clean a finger you don't use that much, such as ring finger, with 70% ethanol
- Pierce the fingertip with a quick prick to the side
- The first liquid is hardly any blood, so wipe it off with the clean and dry cotton ball
- By squeezing your fingertip blood will drip into the hematocrit or centrifuge tube
- Balance a second tube with the same weight and place on opposite sides of the centrifuge
- Spin at full speed for 5 minutes
- Determine the percentage of red blood cells
