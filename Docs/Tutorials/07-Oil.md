07 Oil and water separation
===========================

In this experiment we will investigate the influence of detergents on the ability of the centrifuge to seperate water and oil.

### Materials
- Oil, such as olive oil, sunflower oil or palm oil
- Water from the tap
- Centrifuge tubes
- Detergent, such as hand soap or dishwashing soap 

### Procedure
- Prepare a dilution series of oil in water
- Add different concentrations of detergent to the mixture
- Make sure the tubes are balanced
- Spin in the centrifuge at max speed for 5 minutes
- Observe the separation profiles
