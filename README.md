RWXBioFuge
==========

Centrifugation is a powerful method for isolation of compounds such as DNA, proteins, oil or membrane vesicles from a complex mixture. The RWXBioFuge was designed to bring this powerful tool into the hands of labtechnicans, scientists, hackers, makers, diybio-ers and those who cannot afford to procure A-label equipment in low-resource settings. 

It may also be used as an educational project to teach some fundamental principles of physics, chemistry, biology and electronics hands-on. Apart from an assembly guide, this documentation also includes [7 instructions for demonstration experiments and science classes][6].

This repository contains the code, source files and instructions for operating the RWXBioFuge Open Source microcentrifuge.

- [ArduinoCode][1]: source code for the Arduino Ethernet
- [Rotor][2]: OpenSCAD source code for the rotor, preview at [YouMagine][5]
- [Device][3]: Bill of Materials, 3D model and 2D CAD files
- [Docs][4]: assembly and tutorial documents
