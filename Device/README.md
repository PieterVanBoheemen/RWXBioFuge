The RWXBioFuge consists of solely of-the-shelf parts and laser cut wood that has been designed in Sketchup. Using these source files and the [Assembly Guide][1], you can build your own.

In this folder you will find:

- The Bill of Materials (BoM)
- 3D SketchUp design file
- 2D SVG files of each part
